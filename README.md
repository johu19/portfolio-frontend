Here is the Front-end part developed for the portfolio project.
The UI/UX of this project was not worked on at all, the focus was 100% on functionality

If you want to run the project follow next steps you need npm installed on your machine:
  - Clone project
  - Create a .env file with the respecting environtment variables
  - npm install
  - npm run start


These are the variables needed for .env file, for practical terms they were put in here, but in a real life scenario they should never be shown in such a public way.
